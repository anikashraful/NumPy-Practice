# NumPy-Practice

This repository contains my practice notebooks for learning NumPy, a Python library for numerical computing. The notebooks are created in Google Colab and cover array operations, slicing, and linear algebra.

## ðŸ“‹ Exercises Included
- **Array Creation**: `np.zeros`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`.
- **Slicing**: Extract rows, columns, and conditional elements.
- **Operations**: Element-wise arithmetic and statistics.
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix multiplication and determinants.
- **Broadcasting**: Operations with arrays of different shapes.
- **Array Manipulation**: Reshaping, concatenation, and splitting.
- **Random Numbers**: Uniform, normal, and integer arrays; shuffling.
- **Data Analysis**: Statistics and filtering on a simulated dataset.

## Goals
- Master NumPy fundamentals.
- Apply NumPy to data analysis and small projects.
- Share progress and get feedback.
- Interested in Data Science
